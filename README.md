# OSINT Resources by Country V 2.0
This repo was inspired by wddadk [OSINT for Countries](https://github.com/wddadk/OSINT-for-countries). Here you'll find a collection of links to various OSINT tools, websites, and projects that are specific to different countries. 
Structured for digital profilers. What does it mean: 
On each country page you will find tools and resources grouped by one standard: 
- open bases, statistics
- search for legal and tax information
- maps and cadastres
- cars and license plates
- telephones and other personal identifiers
- public procurement
